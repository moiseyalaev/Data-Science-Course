# Data-Science-Course
A small collection of selected problems tackled in my Data Science course. I took this course Winter of 2020 at UCLA, while the problems were assigned for the class, all the work provided is my own. 

The main topics covered in class were 
* **Least Squares**
* **non-negative matrix factorization (NMF) **
* QR factorization
* LU Decomposition
* **Singular value decomposition (SVD)**
* CP Decomposition (CPD)
* principal component analysis (PCA)
* **Spectral clustering**
* K-nearest neighbors (KNN)
* **Logistic Regression**
* **Gradient decent and cost functions**
* linear and dynamic programming.

Bolded topics are implmented in the selected hw.

Most of the description needed to understand the problems are in the ipynb files. These types of files are best viewed in a Jupyter or CoLab notebook.
