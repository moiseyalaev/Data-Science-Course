# Data-Science-class
A small collection of problems tackled in my Data Science course. I took this course Winter of 2020 at UCLA, while the problems were assigned for the class, all the work provided is my own. Most of the description needed to understand the problems are in the ipynb files. These types of files are beste viewed in Jupyter Notebooks or CoLab notebooks.
